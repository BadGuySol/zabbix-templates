# Zabbix Templates

A collection of Zabbix templates made by Marco Hofmann for his company.
I made changes to the template to use it to get data from MTR along with the Get-Traceroute.ps1 script developed by Tyler Applebaum [Zabbix Network Monitoring with mtr (My traceroute)](https://gist.github.com/tylerapplebaum)
